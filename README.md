# Doksit

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nait-aul/doksit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nait-aul/doksit)

`doksit` is still in development mode and new version 0.2.0 is going to be available around 25th - 27th October with new `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, tutorials, docs etc.

**Current status:** Refactor some parts to OOP for better scalability in the future (easier new features implementation & space for 3rd party extensions).
