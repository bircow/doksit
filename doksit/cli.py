Here are defined command line interfaces (CLI) as functions.

Note:
    The functions docstrings have very short documentation, because they're
    taken as CLI description. Therefore the rest is written in comments.

Warning:
    The source code links below lead to a module file only and not direct
    to specific line number. The reason is that is not possible to locate
    CLI functions using `click` package (bug).
